# Weather-App
A responsive weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches real-time weather data from an API (e.g., OpenWeather) and displays current weather conditions, temperature, and forecasts. This project demonstrates a clean and functional UI, responsive design, and dynamic data handling.
